# SMILES Langage
The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a specification for representing the structure of chemical molecules using ASCII characters. It provides a compact and human-readable way to encode molecular structures, making it easier to store, transmit, and manipulate chemical information in computer systems. SMILES strings consist of a series of characters that represent atoms, bonds, and other structural features of a molecule. They can be used in various applications, such as chemical databases, chemical informatics, and computational chemistry.

SMILES strings are based on a simple set of rules that define how atoms and bonds are represented in the string. Atoms are represented by their atomic symbols (e.g., C for carbon, O for oxygen) and bonds are represented by various symbols (e.g., - for single bonds, = for double bonds). The structure of the molecule is encoded by arranging the atoms and bonds in a linear sequence that reflects the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule.
